To compile mp4fpsmod run "make".
To install into standard prefix (/usr/local) run "make install".
To install somewhere else (i.e. /usr) run "make install DESTDIR=/usr".

The make targets can also be called individually. Running "make" or
"make all" is equivalent to "make configure libmp4v2 mp4fpsmod strip".
