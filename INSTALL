1) Type './bootstrap.sh' to create the files needed to build mp4fpsmod.

2) Then type './configure' to create the configuration. A list of
configure options is printed by running 'configure --help'.

3) Then type 'make' to build mp4fpsmod.

  3.1) It is recommended to type 'strip mp4fpsmod' after the build
       has finished, to strip unneeded symbols from the binary,
       which makes it significantly smaller. This step however is
       not essential and can safely be ignored.

4) Type 'make install' to install the files you built.


Summary:
./bootstrap.sh
./configure && make && strip mp4fpsmod
make install
